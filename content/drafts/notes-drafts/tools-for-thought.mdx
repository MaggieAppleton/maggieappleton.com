<IntroParagraph>

The term __tools for thought__ has become a new rallying point over the last few years. People who might otherwise gather around keywords like _personal knowledge management_, _networked thought_, _productivity_, or _knowledge work_ are reframing their work.

The phrase appears on the landing page of every hot new note-taking app:

[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Neilson](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s 2019 essay on [transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) helped kick off the popularity wave, as well as Andy's [continued research](https://www.patreon.com/quantumcountry) and writing advocating for TFT as a field.

There's something odd in the way people are currently using the term though.

If we take the phrase at face value, as anything that helps humans think different kinds of thoughts, the list of historical examples should certainly include:

- Written language
- Hindu-arabic numeral system
- The Socratic Method
- The Scientific Method
- Data visualisations
- Spreadsheets
- Cartesian coordinates

All of these things pre-date digital computers by at least a few hundred years (if not thousands).
