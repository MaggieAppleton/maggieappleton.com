<IntroParagraph>

Back in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.

My [small collection](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880) highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.

They're not following the same conventions as what we've come to know as the "personal blog". Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like freeform, work-in-progress wikis.

They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.  They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations.  They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.

They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "should be." It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.

# A Brief History of Digital Gardens

Let's begin with the term itself. The notion of a _digital garden_ is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades.

However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.

Tracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born and evolve helps us understand why we needed the word in the first place. Which is a game I am very here for.

## The Early Gardens of Hypertext

Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. 

While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

<Subtext center>Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for</Subtext>

To put it in a bigger picture context, Mark's writing was part of a larger  conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.

The early web-abdopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome">WikiGnomes.</a><Footnote idName={1}>The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites.</Footnote>
These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.

The early web debates around this became known as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31">_The Navigation Problem_</a> – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure. 

> "Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes"

While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.

After Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.

## Digital Puttering on Twitter 

In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term and defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote idName={2}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

https://twitter.com/rorysutherland/status/34981652?s=20


The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space in general**.  

The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.

These people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.

https://twitter.com/Vonster/status/1616935301?s=20

https://twitter.com/jen_thefuture/status/10102084267?s=20

https://twitter.com/TheMacMommy/status/40614201554640896?s=20


Given the lack of reference to the earlier nineties notion of **digital gardening**, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these folks likely they belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.

That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.

## Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors

At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>. It later becomes <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. If anyone should be considered the original source of _digital gardening_, it's Caufield. They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words. 

Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.

<TwoCol width="100%" divpadding="0.6em" imgwidth="380px" imgmargin="0.4em">

<div>

Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by  _streams_ – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events.  The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. <Footnote closed idName={3}>While this may sound obvious now, the streamification of everything was still dawning around 2015.</Footnote>

This is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.

But streams only surface the Zetigeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. <Footnote closed idName={4}>Though the rising popularity of <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/">Twitter threading</a> is an impressive attempt to reconfigure a stream environment and make it more garden-esque.</Footnote>

The _garden_ is our counterbalance. **Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.** Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from [Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevism) to [Celestial Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics) to [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number). It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. **The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.**

> "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."


### Carrying on Caufield

Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.

In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.

The timing co-incided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and reimagining tools for blogging.

Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course was popularising the idea of actively curating personal knowledge. [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) had pioneered ways of interlinking content in a note-taking app. The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community was been championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook.  

Around the web development community, folks like Shawn Wang were advocating [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). Web development tools like like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) were making it easier than ever to spin up personal space on the web. The scene was ripe for new ideas around curating and sharing personal knowledge online.

Tom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the kick-off points. Shortly followed by Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) in early 2019. <Footnote idName={5}>Disclaimer that Joel is a mentor, collaborator and friend, so my exposure to the idea comes from his early advocacy and enthusiasm for it.</Footnote> Over the course of 2019 more people began riffing on the concept. In early 2020 Shaun Wang compiled the [Digital Gardening Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/)

By late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write [a short piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) on it.

## The Six Patterns of Gardening

In all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable confusion around how to define the term. There are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the core ethos should focus on, and whether it's worthy of a new label at all. 

What exactly makes a website a _digital garden_ as opposed to just another personal blog?

After reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide variety of gardens, and collecting some of the [best examples](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), I've identified a few key qualities they all share.

This amounts to a kind of digital garderning [[Pattern Language]]. A few guiding principles, design patterns and structures people are rallying around.

### 1. Topography over Timelines 

Traditional blogs use the timeline as their primary organisational structure. Posts are presented in reverse chronological order by their publication date.

Gardens are don't use chronology as their main organising rule. They're organised by contextual relationships. The concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others. Notes link to other notes that touch on similar themes and topics. One of the best ways to do this is through [[Bi-directional Links]] – links that make both the destination page and the source page visible to the reader.

<BasicImage margin="2em auto 1em" width="700px" alt="A linear timeline of posts vs. a spatial layout of connected posts" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1609617065/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/timeline-topography_shrink.png" />

Ideally, a garden will offer a number of entry points and ways of browsing its contents. Dense links are essential, but gardeners often layer on other ways of exploring their knowledge base.

They might have [thematic piles](https://busterbenson.com/piles/), [nested folders](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/), tags and filtering functionality, [advanced search bars](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/garden), [visual node graphs](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), or [central indexes](https://www.gwern.net/index) listing notable and popular content.

### 2. Continuous Growth 

Gardens are always growing. They're continously evolving work in progress.

Last updated, not published

Digital gardening is *low friction* - tending it shouldn't take more effort than a Tweet.
Just like a real garden, watering and clipping it is part of a daily ritual.

### 3. Learning in Public & Imperfection

Blog posts present an established opinion, collections of connected ideas don't know what they think yet.

Right to be wrong
Digital gardening terms of service

Our existing understanding of blogging is performative. The [Premium Medicore](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism defined the last decade of blogging as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns.

Informal, personal streams of ideas were sidelined into social media or burrowed underground on the [[Cozy Web]].

Digital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) version of the personal blog. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than our Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations. 

<FullWidthImage width="900px" alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1600/v1593765637/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/digital-garden.png" />

### 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental

Gardens are by nature non-homogenous. No two gardens are alike. Even if you plant the same plants as your neighbours, you plant them in a different arrangement.

The point of the garden is that's it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that are particular to you.

Medium, Wordpress, and Squarespace created the standardised, monotone personal website. The digital garden invites people to use the web's native languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to experiment with weirder, wilder designs.

<BasicImage width="800px" margin="2em auto" alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1609617065/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/unique-gardens_shrink.png" />

Personal gardens are about __contextualisation__. One of the overwhelming lessons of the last decade of Web 2.0 social-media-driven platforms is that dumping millions of people together into unregulated social spaces, devoid of any established social norms, and abstracted from their specific cultural identities and context, is a shit show.

A 240 character bio on Twitter, or a fill-in-the-form profile on Facebook limits the scope of how we present ourselves. The platform picks the categories it deems important - relationship status, gender, hometown.

Gardens offer us the ability to present ourselves in forms that aren't cookie cutter profiles.

### 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity

All varieties of mediums grow in the garden - videos, podcasts, short notes, long essays, academic papers, sketches.

### 6. Independent Ownership

A large part of gardening is claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.

One that does not live on the servers of Facebook, Twitter, or Medium. If any of those go under, your writing and creations sink with it (crazier things have happened in the span of humanity). There is no easy export button for Twitter.

The garden plans for long-term change.

No one can take your garden away. If you give it a bit of forethought – storing notes in flat markdown files – you can built it in a way that easily transfers as platforms and technologies inevitably change.

---

This is my take on it, but knowledge and neologisms always live within communities and no one owns _The Official Definition_ of digital gardening. Numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation and you should read their thoughts as well.

## Futuristic Communal Gardening

A key piece of the narrative I've left out until now is the discussion around what our current gardens *lack*

One strong thread that runs through all these gardening theories is the dream of _communal gardening_
