My [[Roam Garden]] is a place I spend between 2-4 hours puttering around in every day according to my <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> stats <Footnote idName={1}>RescueTime only tracks the time you're actively focused on a single window, so this measurement has some limitations but sets a nice baseline</Footnote>

<BasicImage width="650px" alt="A bar graph of the hours I've spent in Roam this week" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_660/v1590188743/maggieappleton.com/notes/roamhours.png" />

<p>If I'm staring into something for over twenty hours a week, it better look and feel like beautiful home that fits my aesthetic tastes. <Footnote idName={2}>As a maker of aesthetically pleasing things, I'm obviously biased towards the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic%E2%80%93usability_effect">Aesthetic Usability Effect</a></Footnote></p>

In that spirit, I've gone all-out on customising the CSS that controls how my Roam looks.

I've used colours and font weight to distinguished internal from external links, added custom colours to particular page names, and shifted the contrast and spacing of elements to fit my own design aesthetic.

<h2>How to Paint Roam Your Own Colours</h2>

<p>Luckily, this is all fairly easy to do. Roam has a built-in system for customising how your database looks.</p>

You first need to create a new page called `roam/css`.

<ImageFrame width="840px" alt="The roam search bar with roam/css entered" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1607173029/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.47.43.png" />

Once there, create a new code block by typing `/code` and selecting the block option.

<ImageFrame width="840px" alt="Entering /code into the empty page" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1607173035/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.48.46.png" />

Once the code block appears, set the language to `css` from the right-hand drop down menu.

<ImageFrame width="840px" alt="Selecting the code option from the code block dropdown menu" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1607173038/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.48.56.png" />

You're now ready to start customising the CSS of your Roam. Any CSS you enter into this new code block will be applied across your whole database.

To test if it's working, type `h1.rm-title-display span { color: salmon;}` into the box.  
The title of your new page should change to a lovely shade of salmon.

#### If you've not entirely sure what CSS is, or you've never written any, I strongly suggest you first work through this short course on Khan Academy

<p><a noTip href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics"><button style={{marginTop: '0.2em'}}>Intro to CSS on Khan Academy</button> </a></p>

<p>It'll take 30 minutes and learning the basics will give you an enourmous appreciation for how the web works (as well as how to control it for your own benefit!)</p>

<p>After that, check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css">this Google guide</a> to how to look up CSS elements and selectors a live webpage.</p>

## Pre-made Roam Themes

For those of you entirely uninterested in learning CSS who just want to pop a pre-made theme in, Roam has a whole collection of [pre-made themes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY) you can pick from.

Copy and paste any of them into your new `roam/css` page and the styles will be applied across your whole database

If you want to use my theme **Leyendecker**, the most up-to-date version is avaliable this [Github repo](https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css). There's a older version listed on the [Roam database](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY).

## Custom Styling Tags and Page Links

Another neat trick I love with CSS and Roam is creating specific styles for different page title and tags. <Footnote idName={3}>Shoutout to fellow Roam user <a href="https://malcolmocean.com/">Malcolm Ocean</a> who lobbied for this as an official feature of the Roam interface. I found out how to do it digging around in their impressively <a href="https://gist.github.com/malcolmocean/03d777a1c8f89be8c98e3d89d6821607">comprehensive CSS files</a></Footnote>

I have a little workflow taxonomy going that covers different kinds of output and the stages they flow through

<FullWidthImage width="880px" alt="A screencapture of my Roam database with various coloured tags" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1457/v1590193543/maggieappleton.com/notes/datatags.png" />


We're able to do this because when we use the double bracket or add a # to create a page tag, Roam adds a new attribute to the HTML markup. If the page is made with a #, it adds a `data-tag` attribute. If it's made with double brackets Roam adds a `data-link-title` attribute


```html
<span data-tag="Ideas" class="rm-page-ref rm-page-ref-tag">  
    #Ideas What if I learned how to chuck wood
    like a Chuck Norris woodchuck could? 
</span>

<span data-link-title="Ideas" class="rm-page-ref">  
    [ [Ideas] ] What if I learned how to chuck wood like a Chuck Norris woodchuck could? 
</span>
```

We can then target both of those attributes  with a CSS selector that looks like this:

```css
span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"],
span[data-link-title^="Tweet"] .rm-page-ref {
    color: #FCB815;
    padding: 3px 4px;
    font-weight: 700;
    line-height: 1.4em;
}
```

The first selector, `span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"]` changes any # link, and the second `span[data-link-title^="Tweet"] .rm-page-ref` selector changes any link made with [ [ brackets]]

It makes an enormous difference in your user experience to be able to quickly identify different block and note types through visual colour association.

If you just want to grab the tag and page styles from my theme , scroll down to the bottom of my <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css">CSS theme file</a> to find them.

## Block Level Styling

Roam also allows you to style whole blocks based on tags. <Footnote idName={4}>[Cato Minor](https://twitter.com/catominor3?lang=en) originally wrote a script for doing this in JavaScript, but now it's native to Roam's CSS.</Footnote>

In my database I use this heavily when taking book notes to visually distinguish between claims, responses, questions, and evidence.

To style an entire block, and all its child elements, we use:

```css
.roam-block-container[data-page-links*='Comment'] {
    // styles in here
}
```

To style only the child elements but not the parent, add `.rm-block-children` to the end use:

```css
.roam-block-container[data-page-links*='Comment'] .rm-block-children {
    // styles in here
}
```

To style just the block itself but none of the child elements, add `> div.rm-block-main` on:

```css
.roam-block-container[data-page-links*='Comment'] > div.rm-block-main {
    // styles in here
}
```

## Alternate Styling with Browser Plugins

If you don't want to use the native Roam CSS functionality, there's a way to apply custom CSS styles to any website using a browser plugin.

This is especially useful if you're part of a **multi-player** Roam where everyone has their own styling preferences.

<p><a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/">Stylus</a> is a great choice and has extensions for both <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">Chrome</a></p>

<ImageFrame width="920px" alt="A screen capture of the stylus interface" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1720/v1590188865/maggieappleton.com/notes/stylus.png" />

They also have <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor">good documentation</a> that will walk you through how to use it.

It's good to note that this is not a Roam-specific hack.  You can re-paint any webpage you like with a custom CSS styler (go to town on Craigslist!)
