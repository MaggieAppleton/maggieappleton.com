#### Digital Prepper

Riffing off **doomsday preppers**, people who have seen so many centralised services shut down, they default to Open Source Softwareto prevent losing their data and system setups.

#### Brahmin Left

"The “left” has become the party of the intellectual elite (Brahmin left), while the “right” can be viewed as the party of the business elite (Merchant right). In India’s traditional caste system, upper castes were divided into Brahmins (priests, intellectuals) and Kshatryas/Vaishyas (warriors, merchants, tradesmen). To some extent the modern political conflict seems to follow this division."

#### Milk Toast

Vanilla, bland, flavourless Normie behaviour.

Someone might be Milk Toast if the primary features of their personality centre around liking avocados, watching Game of Thrones, and "travel"

#### Hospice Mode

The stage your when your phone / fitness tracker / laptop is in its final months and you're just prolonging its death through a series of coping techniques. Carrying around extra battery packs. Patiently giving it 10 minutes to restart. Resetting the system at regular intervals. Just give up.

#### Pinkering

Named for Steven Pinker - a common phenomenon among do-gooder elites who cite the long arc of human history in order to downplay and minimise any immediate suffering.

Another variety is _Economic Pinkering_ which justifies any economic concerns by simply citing how many Chinese people have been lifted into the middle class.

#### Greenpilling

The climate crisis version of Redpilling, Blackpilling, etc.

#### Zumping

Possibly due to a lack of Zex.

#### Subtweeting

It's about them. And we all know it's about them.
But you're not going to tag them or address them directly. The ultimate expression of digital passive aggression.

#### Yak Shaving

Embarking on a sequence of nested tasks to accomplish a goal, where each step seems logical and necessary in the moment, but becomes less and less linked to the original goal.

You set out to fix a broken image in your code, which leads to refactoring the image rendering function, which requires updating your npm packages, but first you need to plan this all out in Jira, and then install the latest version of Adobe Flash, and on and on in seemingly logical sequence until you find yourself in a zoo... shaving a yak.
