This book made the rounds in my mother's community of international librarians. They spend a lot of time working on initiatives to diversify library collections, and bring in the voices of marginalised perspectives. She assured me I'd love it, and she was right.

At first I was put off by the trite subtitle. Anytime a book title promises to _save the world_, _change your life_, or _make you question everything_, it's safe to assume an patronising publisher came up with it. No author is egotistical enough to write that sort of hyperbole.
