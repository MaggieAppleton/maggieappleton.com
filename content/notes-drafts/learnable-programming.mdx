Bret Victor coined the term **Learnable Programming** in their [canonical essay]() on the matter.

The TLDR of Victor's manifesto is...

The Edward Tufte of programming.

Enough with the fawning. 

How should we teach programming?

We're still in the baby phases of how to do this. The interaction Web 2.0 is only X years old. 

Almost all programming education is based around linear video and text experiences ([egghead](https://egghead.io/) included).

I keep a hefty collection of interactive experiences focused around programming education in particular.
And began to notice some trends – an emerging [[Pattern Languages]] between these sites.

This is an incomplete and ongoing observational list.

1. Location and Destination

Showing the learner where they are now, and where they're headed.

2. Brownie Points



3. Compare and Contrast

4. Immersive Focused

5. Invitations to Explore / You Figure it Out

No obvious instructions and fully exploratory. You figure out what you're supposed to do as the game unfolds.

6. The Invisible Narrator

7. What You See is What You Get

We may not have achieved the code-less dream for web design yet, but at least we have it in our educational games.

At the moment it's mostly CSS-focused games that can easily take advantage of this pattern, since it's inherently visual.

Both by [Codepip](https://codepip.com/) who make a number of these style of educational games

8. Explain in Context

9. Cry for Help

10. Revisit the Past

Spaced repetition

11. Flow over time

12. Embodied Space over Symbolic text

13. Unpack the Black Box
