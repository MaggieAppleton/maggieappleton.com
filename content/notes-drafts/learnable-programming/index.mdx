Bret Victor coined the term **Learnable Programming** in their <a href="">canonical essay</a> on the matter.

As someone who spends a great deal of time thinking through how to visually explain programming concepts, while immersed in a text-obsessed culture, Victor feels like a prophet of Syntax.

The Edward Tufte of programming.

Enough with the fawning.
