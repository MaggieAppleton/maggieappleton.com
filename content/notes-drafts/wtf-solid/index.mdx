The Web is a work of art, but not perfection.

It's easy for us to wax lyrical about the magically unifying, Global-Villagey, mind-hive of emergent human knowledge the World Wide Web created.

But those kind of poetics overshadow a set of very real and concerning flaws. 

Link rot. Control and ownership over personal data. Payments. Unique, secure identification.  Attribution. Duplication.  The fact many people around the world <a href="">think Facebook *is* the internet</a>.

The indelible <a href="">Tim Berners-Lee agrees</a>.

In 201X he kicked off a project to reconfigure how the web works. Squarely aimed at addressing the worst of these problems.
