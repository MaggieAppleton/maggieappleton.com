Building this Digital Garden has been quite the pet project. I crafted it using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a> - a <a href="https://www.reactjs.com">React-based</a> static site generator that gives you a decent balance between convenience and control.

But it's currently missing one killer feature...

> ✶ The Bi-Directional Link ✶

I wrote up A Short History of Bi-Directional Links if you need a bit of background context on the idea.

On **May 19th** I'll be hanging out with <a href="https://aengusmcmillin.com/">Aengus McMillin</a>, <a href="https://aravindballa.com/">Aravind Balla</a>, and <a href="https://www.ianjones.us/notes">Ian Jones</a> (my digital gardening co-conspirator) on a livestream and showing how to set up a bi-directional linking system in Gatsby -- with this site as the guinea pig.

We'll be implementing Aengus's <a href="https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain">gatsby-theme-brain</a> which, much like it sounds, is a Gatsby theme that will help us build that brain-like system of interlinking nodes.

<p>We'll then add Aravind's <a href="https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy">gatsby-theme-andy</a> which gives us preview pop-overs when you hover on page links.</p>

<h5 style="opacity: 80%; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 2em; line-height: 1.5em; padding-top: 1em; max-width: 660px; border-top: 1px solid lightgrey;">Don't worry if you can't make it. I'll post the recording here afterwards, as well as notes on the process.</h5>

<!--
In preparation, I started planning out the UX design considerations of this feature.

### What exactly does this look like in action?

We'll need to consider a number of design issues:

1. How will users know if a link is internal or external?
    - On most sites these all look the same, and you find out where you're headed once you've clicked. Making users randomly guess where a link is headed isn't a great UX experience.
    - I like solving this with URL preview tooltips for externals (implemented with Tippy.js)
    - And I also distinguish them with colour - blue leads to the outside web, orange stays inside.
2. How can we visually distinguish between internal links that lead to pages like 'Home' or 'About' vs. links that lead to other notes?
    - Even with the colour distinction, there's now going to be two kinds of internal links - ones to "normal" pages, and ones to linked notes
3. How much content should we show in hover previews for internal page links?
4. How do we visually display page references? -->
